    <strong>RecurDyn</strong> is Integrated Multi-Discipline (IMD) Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) software. Its primary purpose is <strong>Multi-Flexible Body Dynamics <u>(MFBD)</u></strong>, which is the prediction of the motion of mechanisms and devices composed of solid bodies, in which the bodies can be modeled as either rigid or flexible bodies. RecurDyn contains many components, such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Optimization Design, Automatic Control, Fatigue Analysis, as well as rigid Multibody Dynamics.

    <p style="margin-top:30px;"><strong>RecurDyn</strong> has superior calculation efficiency because it is based on a recursive formulation. Therefore, <strong>RecurDyn</strong> gives the best performance in large-scale multibody problems (systems with a large number of bodies), including mechanical systems in which complex contact between bodies is very significant. <strong>RecurDyn</strong> also features a natural, Windows-based User Interface which is intuitive and easy to use, as well as a custom application development environment which enables users to automate complicated and/or tedious tasks.
